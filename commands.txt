These are the script commands that ar available at the interactive
processing window. These are TCL commands, so basic understanding of
Tcl scripting is assumed.

* axes <name>

Return an ordered list of dimensions for the axes of the named
item. For example, a 640x480 grayscale image has the axes dimensions
"640 480". This uses the FITS definition of image axes, so
multi-spectral images put color information in another axis. So an RGB
color image would have axes dimensions "640 480 3".


* bench names

Get a list of the bench tree items that have script names.

* bench display_text <name>

Get the display string for the named item.


* scratch new <name> <display-name> <type> <axes-list>

Create a new scratch image with the script name <name>. Use
<display-name> as the name to display, and create an image with the
<axes-list> dimensions.
