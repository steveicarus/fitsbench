These are the script commands that ar available at the interactive
processing window. These are TCL commands, so basic understanding of
Tcl scripting is assumed.

* axes <name>

Return an ordered list of dimensions for the axes of the named
item. For example, a 640x480 grayscale image has the axes dimensions
"640 480". This uses the FITS definition of image axes, so
multi-spectral images put color information in another axis. So an RGB
color image would have axes dimensions "640 480 3".


* bench names

Get a list of the bench tree items that have script names.

* bench display_text <name>

Get the display string for the named item.

* crop <dst> <axes-list> <src> <start-point>

Crop an array from the source. The destination can have fewer
dimensions then the source array, but must fit entirely within the
source array. Also, the <start-point> dimensions must match the
dimensions of the <src> image.

* scratch new <name> <display-name> <type> <axes-list>

Create a new scratch image with the script name <name>. Use
<display-name> as the name to display, and create an image with the
<axes-list> dimensions.

* minmax <src>

Scan an image to find the minimum and maximum pixel values. The result
is a list of 4 items: The minimum value, the address of the minimum,
the maximum value, and its address.

* phase_correlate <dest> <src1> <src2>

Do a phase correlation of the <src1> and <src2> images, and put the
resulting image into <dest>. The <src1> and <src2> images must have
the same type and dimensions. The <dest> image will have the same
dimensions but a type of native double.
